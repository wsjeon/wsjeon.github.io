Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Mila and School of Computer Science, McGill University under the supervision of Prof. [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/). <!--Previously, I was *a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST* . For both postdoc periods,--> Since 2017, I've been interested in various topics in reinforcement learning. Mainly, I've been working on imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning, considering how to efficiently learn from demonstrations.

<!--During M.S. and Ph. D. at KAIST, I had worked on wireless communication problems and their limitations from the perspectives of information theory, electromagnetism and antenna theory.-->

For more information, please check my [CV](https://wsjeon.github.io/pdfs/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf) and [research statement](https://wsjeon.github.io/pdfs/Research_Statement.pdf).
