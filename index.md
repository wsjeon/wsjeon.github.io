I'm currently *a postdoctoral researcher at Mila/McGill University*. Previously, I was *a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST* . For both postdoc periods, I've been considering the problems of reinforcement learning, imitation learning, inverse reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning, and proposed efficient and simplified methods for those problems.

During M.S. and Ph. D. at KAIST, I had worked on wireless communication problems and their limitations from the perspectives of information theory, electromagnetism and antenna theory.
